# push_swap_42

### Skills learned from project
- Understanding devide and conquer algorithms
- How to use data structures (linked list & stack)

### Project goals
Push_swap is a project in the 42 curriculum about sorting algorithms. The programme takes an array of integers as input and proceeds to sort them. You're only allowed to use two "stacks" to sort these numbers. Thankfully these "stacks" are allowed to perform more actions than a regular stack. They can rotate their content or swap their first two variables. Because of this, I implemented these stacks as linked lists, because they're much easier to rotate. For the sorting algorithm I used Radix Sort, a fast, but easy to understand algorithm.
